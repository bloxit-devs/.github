AlvinBlox and TheDevKing are two other beginner's choice creators. However, many members of Blox-it agree that they are not reliable sources for learning. Their tutorials often focus on showing results rather than explaining the underlying concepts, use poor practices that can lead to bad habits, or fail to provide a solid foundation for understanding scripting principles. As a result, learners may struggle to apply the knowledge effectively in their own projects.
