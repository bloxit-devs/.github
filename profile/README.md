# Welcome to Blox-it.
The home for everyone who shares the passion of creating something amazing on Roblox.

## About Blox-it
Blox-it was born out of the shared desire of four Roblox developers to create a community that would bring Roblox developers closer together. The quartet - who all met while working on Roblox projects - decided to pool their knowledge and create a space where Roblox developers could collaborate, share ideas, and support each other.

Since its creation in 2021, Blox-it has become a go-to destination for Roblox developers of all skill levels. The community has grown exponentially, and now boasts hundreds of members from all over the world. It has grown into a thriving community of developers who are constantly innovating and collaborating on new projects. Blox-it has also been a valuable resource for new developers who are just getting started with Roblox.

The founders of Blox-it are proud of what they've built and are committed to continuing to grow the community and make it even more valuable for everyone involved.

This is your place to call home. This is Blox-it.
